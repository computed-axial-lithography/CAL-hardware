# DISCLAIMER!!!
BEWARE THERE ARE KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE FOCUSING THE IMAGE WITH THIS COMBINATION OF OPTICAL HARDWARE AND THE 3D PRINTED CASING!!!

We are working on a new design that is based on an optical breadboard and will provide more flexibility for focus adjusment, optical alignment, and print container alignment. If you are considering building a CAL system, we **strongly suggest** you wait until this new design is available before purchasing/building anything.

This new design is expected to be available in **June 2021**. Email jtoombs@berkeley.edu if you have questions about this.
